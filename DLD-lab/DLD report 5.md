## Title: 
Design and Implementation of Binary to Gray Code and Gray to Binary Code Converters

## Objectives:
- To understand Gray code and its conversion from binary code.
- To design and implement the converter circuits using logic gates.
- To test the circuits by providing all possible input combinations.

## Apparatus:
- Breadboard
- Connecting wires
- Logic gates (XOR)
- LEDs and resistors

## Components:
- IC 7486 for XOR gate
- Push buttons
- Power supply

## Theory:
Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. The conversion from binary to Gray code follows these rules:
- The Most Significant Bit (MSB) remains the same as the binary MSB.
- Other bits are obtained by applying the XOR operation between the current and previous binary bits. Gray to binary conversion is the reverse process.

### Procedure:
1. Design the logic circuits based on the conversion principles.
2. Connect the ICs and logic gates on the breadboard.
3. Use push buttons to input binary values and simulate Gray values.
4. Observe the output LEDs for each input combination.
5. Record the results.

### Results:
The binary to Gray and Gray to binary converters exhibited correct functionality for all tested input combinations. The LEDs accurately reflected the corresponding Gray or binary outputs.

## Conclusion:
This experiment successfully showcased the design and implementation of binary to Gray code and Gray to binary code converters using logic gates. The observed outcomes of the circuits matched the anticipated results. The practical application of digital logic concepts and understanding of Gray code fundamentals were effectively reinforced through this experiment.
