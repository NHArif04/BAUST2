<h3><b>Question:</b></h3>
<h3>Explain Rutherford atomic model with its limitations.</h3>
<blockquote>In 1911 Rutherford proposed a model for Î± particle scattering experiment which is given below:</blockquote>

<p>Center of atom is positively charged, all the masses of the atom concentrated in it. Its volume is negligible compared with the volume of atom. Which/This is called the nucleus of atom. [4]</p>

<p>Atoms are electrically neutral. Number of positively charged proton present in nucleus is equal to the number of negatively charged electron revolving around the nucleus. As the planets revolving around the sun in the solar system, electron are also revolving around the nucleus in atom. So, the structure of atom is comparable with solar system. So, this model is known as solar system atomic model. [10]</p>

<p>The comparison of structure of atom with the solar system is the main limitation of Rutherford atomic model. Rutherford atomic model cannot explain the rotation of electron around the nucleus of atom according to Max-Well law. [15]</p>
