<h2><br><mark>Bohr Atomic Model</mark></h2>
<h3><b>Question:</b></h3>
<h3>Explain Bohr atomic model with its limitations.</h3>
<blockquote>In 1913 scientist Niels Bohr proposed a new model for the explanation of structure of atom. This model is given below:</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>There are some fixed orbits around the nucleus of an atom. In which electrons are revolving without absorbing or releasing energy. These are know as energy level or shell and denoted by K, L, M, N, ... or 1, 2, 3, ....</li>
  <li>Electron can jump from one orbit to another by absorbing or releasing energy. If electron jump from higher to lower energy orbit it have to release energy and from low energy level to higher energy level it have to absorb energy.</li>
</ol>

<h4><u>Limitations:</u></h4>
<ol>
  <li>It can explain only the structure of Hydrogen atom.</li>
  <li>It can not explain the spectrum produced by shifting electron.</li>
</ol>

<br><br>

<h4><b>Atomic Number:</b></h4>
<blockquote>Number of protons present in nucleus of atom.</blockquote>

<h4><b>Mass Number:</b></h4>
<blockquote>Number of protons and neutrons present in nucleus of an atom.</blockquote>
