## <mark>Structure of Atom</mark>
## Atom:
> Smallest part of the elements which can not exists independently but can take part in chemical reaction directly is known as atom.
<br>

### <b>Question:</b>
### Explain Rutherford atomic model with its limitations. 
>In 1911 Rutherford proposed a model for Î± particle scattering experiment which is given below:
<br><br>
>Center of atom is positively charged, all the masses of the atom concentrated in it. Its volume is negligible compared with the volume of atom. Which/This is called the nucleus of atom. [4]
<br><br>
Atoms are electrically neutral. Number of positively charged proton present in nucleus is equal to the number of negatively charged electron revolving around the nucleus. As the planets revolving around the sun in the solar system, electron are also revolving around the nucleus in atom. So, the structure of atom is comparable with solar system. So, this model is known as solar system atomic model. [10]
<br><br>
The comparison of structure of atom with the solar system is the main limitation of Rutherford atomic model. Rutherford atomic model cannot explain the rotation of electron around the nucleus of atom according to Max-Well law. [15]

## <mark>Bohr Atomic Model</mark>
### <b>Question:</b>
### Explain Bohr atomic model with its limitations. 
> In 1913 scientist Niels Bohr proposed a new model for the explanation of structure of atom. This model is given below:
<br>

1. > There are some fixed orbits around the nucleus of an atom. In which electrons are revolving without absorbing or releasing energy. These are know as energy level or shell and denoted by K, L, M, N, ... or 1, 2, 3, ....
<br>

2. > Electron can jump from one orbit to another by absorbing or releasing energy. If electron jump from higher to lower energy orbit it have to release energy and from low energy level to higher energy level it have to absorb energy.
<br><br>

### <u>Limitations:</u><br>
1. > It can explain only the structure of Hydrogen atom. 
2. > It can not explain the spectrum produced by shifting electron.

## Lecture - 3
## <mark>Quantum Number</mark>
### <b>Question:</b>
### What is Quantum Number? Describe them.
> The number which used to explain the complete arrangement of electrons around the nucleus of atom are know as quantum number.
There are
<ol type=" i ">
  <li>Principal quantum number (n)</li>
  <li>Azimuthal quantum number (l) -> Angular momentum Q.N.</li>
  <li>Magnetic quantum number (m)</li>
  <li>Spin quantum number (s)</li>
</ol>


<br>

#### Principal Quantum Number:
> The quantum number which used to explain the distance of an electron from the nucleus of an atom is known as principal quantum number. Denoted by n = 1,2,3,... any integer number. If the value of n increase the distance of electron from the nucleus will also increase.

<br>

#### Azimuthal Quantum Number:  <mark>Important</mark>
> The quantum number which used to explain the number and name of sub-shell present in any shell is known as azimuthal quantum number.
Denoted by l and its value is from 0 to n-1 (integer value).<br>
<i>:</i>. l = 0 -> (n-1)
<br>
When l = 0, sub-shell will be 's'<br>
When l = 1, sub-shell will be 'p'<br>
When l = 2, sub-shell will be 'd'<br>
When l = 3, sub-shell will be 'f'<br>

<br>

#### Magnetic Quantum Number: <mark>Important</mark>
> The quantum number which used to explain the number of orbital present in any shell or sub-shell is known as magnetic quantum number. Denoted by m.<br>
<i>:</i>. m = +l -> 0 -> -l<br>
The number of m indicate number of orbital.

<br>

#### Spin Quantum Number:
> The quantum number which used to explain the rotation of two electrons in an orbital is known as spin quantum number. Denoted by s.<br>
<i>:</i>. s = +1/2, -1/2<br>
<br>
